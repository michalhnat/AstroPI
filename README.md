# NDVI Calculation on ISS - AstroPi2021 Project

## Overview
This project calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from images captured by a Raspberry Pi camera on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the AstroPi contest. NDVI helps in assessing vegetation health on Earth.

## Key Features
- Captures images from the ISS using a Raspberry Pi camera.
- Calculates NDVI to evaluate vegetation health.
- Uses Python, OpenCV, and matplotlib for processing and analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Capture Images**: Uses a Raspberry Pi camera to take pictures from the ISS.
2. **Calculate NDVI**: Applies NDVI calculation on the captured images to determine vegetation health.
3. **Display Results**: Shows the NDVI results using a color map to represent vegetation health.


## Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Python
- PiCamera
- OpenCV
- matplotlib


## Note
This project is for educational purposes as part of our high school science and technology curriculum.
